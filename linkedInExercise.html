					<h3>The Ask</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="basicText"><span>Goal:</span> The goal of this exercise is for [LinkedIn] to get a better understanding of your end to end design thought process and execution, starting from initial ideations/sketches/research all the way through to a polished end product. It is also meant to be interpreted however [I] see fit and [LinkedIn] recommends that [I] present [my] work in a clear, concise and visually appealing way.</p>
						<p class="basicText"><span>Introduction:</span> LinkedIn is a network of over 550 million professionals. We use the power of professional networking and profile data to connect individuals with relevant opportunities. Hiring managers and recruiters are frequently interested in people who are already employed or satisfied with their current positions.</p>
						<p class="basicText"><span>Task:</span> Design an experience that presents job opportunities to a passive candidate, who is not actively looking for a new position. Find creative solutions that gains the passive candidate's interest in a new position, and garners a response.</p>
						<p class="basicText"><span>Scope:</span> Please think through the end to end experience, and share your thought process, approach, insights and analysis with us. The final deliverable should be a high-fidelity design comp/comps that demonstrate your interaction and visual design capabilities.</p>

			<!-- Research -->
			<div id="linkedinResearch">

					<h3>Research</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="basicText"><span>Research Goals:</span> My main research goal is to learn more about the target users: passive candidates, or people who are not actively looking for new jobs. I aim to understand their mindsets and sentiments regarding applying to jobs, how they currently use LinkedIn, their past experiences applying to jobs and what motivates them to apply to jobs or not. I also want to understand what LinkedIn is already doing to present jobs to passive candidates and garner actions.</p>
						<!-- <p class="basicText"><span>Initial research questions:</span>
							<ul>
								<li>What do you use LinkedIn for?</li>
								<li>When was the last time you used LinkedIn and what did you do when you went on?</li>
								<li>Has a recruiter ever reached out to you to try to get you to apply to a job while you were content at your current job? What was that experience like?</li>
								<li>Have you ever applied to an open job position even though you were content with your job? Why did you apply even though you were content? What made you apply?</li>
								<li>What is LinkedIn already doing to present passive candidates with job opportunities and garner responses?</li>
							</ul>
						</p> -->
						<p class="basicText"><span>Interviews:</span> The first thing I did was reach out to some of the target users. Due to the limited time frame and the specific user group, I decided that it would be best to have a few in depth conversations with users about their qualitative usage habits and sentiments rather than put out a survey to collect shorter form data. I asked each interviewee specific questions, but all of the interviews opened up to broader conversations. I talked to people with a variety of experience levels and in a variety of industries. Each interviewee is on LinkedIn and is not “actively looking” for new jobs. I spoke with 6 people.</p>
						<p class="basicText"><a class="link">Click to see a document of notes from the conversations.</a></p>
						<br><p class="basicText"><span>Key Insights:</span><br>
							<p class="basicText" style="margin-left: 24px;">Phases: Users expressed that they use LinkedIn less when they are not actively apply to jobs and more when they are actively searching for new jobs<br><br>
							Curiosity: Users expressed curiosity to know “what was out there” or how their skills can be applied to different jobs that they don’t already know about. Even though these users aren’t actively looking for new jobs, they are still curious.<br><br>
							Connection: If the passive candidate has personal connections to employees of a company they will be more likely to apply. If the candidate feels like they have a “human” connection with a recruiter (such as if the recruiter takes the time to call them, makes their message relevant to the specific candidates skills or background, or sends a humorous messages) the passive candidate will be more likely to take the job posting seriously.<br><br>
							Irrelevance: The users are often presented with jobs, but often don’t apply because they feel the job is irrelevant to their interests, they do not have the proper skill set for the job, the location is not a place they want to live or the company is not a company they would like to work for.<br><br>
							Trust: Users chose to apply to jobs based on how clear and trustworthy the recruiter seems, concise descriptions and referrals from colleagues they trust</p>
						</p>
						<br><p class="basicText"><span>Quotes from Interviews:</span><br>
							<p class="basicText" style="margin-left: 24px;">“Even though I like my job, I am always curious to know what is out there and learn new things. I sometimes wonder how the skills that I have developed in the school that I work in could be applied to other kinds of organizations, like museums or research groups.” (Dean of Faculty, K-8 Private School, 18 years of experience)<br><br>
							“I frequently get sought after by businesses which are wildly irrelevant to anything I’m interested in.” (Wearable Apparel Designer, Fashion Design Company, 6 months of experience)<br><br>
							“I appreciate when the recruiters are honest and straightforward and when the job descriptions are concise. I am also more likely to respond to someone if I see that we have connections in common because I know that the recruiter is sending quality content.” (Head of products, Marketing and Design, Restaurant Technology Company, 21 years experience)<br><br>
							“Once I left my current job, even though I was happy there, because the people from inside of the organization really wanted me to apply and to come work with them. I didn’t apply because of a recruiter, it was because I knew people there.” (Consultant, Non-profit that supports college students, 30 years of experience)
						</p>
						<p class="basicText"><span>Current LinkedIn Solutions:</span><br>
							I observed that LinkedIn currently presents passive candidates with jobs by:
							<ul>
								<li>Giving the passive candidates information to recruiters who send them LinkedIn messages, emails or phone calls about open jobs</li>
								<li>Presenting job posting in the briefcase section of the platform</li>
								<li>Sending emails and notifications about job postings</li>
								<li>Putting job postings in the news feed (either because of a post by a recruiter or just a posting with an online application)</li>
								<li>Showing if the candidate has a connection that works for the company</li>
								<li>Allowing the candidate to “save” the job and apply later</li>
								<li>Allowing candidates to specify that the job is not interesting to them</li>
								<li>Quick apply</li>
								<li>Providing users with a public place to display their credentials and past experience as well as see what their professional connections are doing in their careers</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p class="basicText">*I recognize that my research methods where limited. I could have improved my study by talking to more people from a larger variety of backgrounds, from countries outside of the US, in different industries and with different experience levels. I also could have conducted longer and more in depth interviews and also coupled the interviews with quantitative data about how often these users used LinkedIn, how long they have been in their jobs, how satisfied they are in their jobs, their click rates on job postings, how often they receive emails, phone calls or LinkedIn messages from recruiters, how often they apply to jobs, etc.</p>

								<li>Has not been using LinkedIn very much lately, though she used it more often when she was applying to jobs</li>
								<li>Recently has only gone on LinkedIn because of emails or notifications about connection requests and people viewing her profile</li>
								<li>Busy, and sense she is content at her job, apply to new jobs is not a priority</li>
								<li>Open to learning about a variety of different jobs in her industry or jobs in other industries that would require her skill set</li>
								<li>Curious about what jobs are out there, what types of things other organizations in the industry are doing and prioritizing</li>

						</p>
						<p class="basicText"><span>Persona 2:</span> 
							<ul>
								<li>Content at her current job and not actively apply to jobs</li>
								<li>Uses LinkedIn regularly (almost every day or a few times a week) to read industry specific news, read insights from connections and stay up to date on colleagues’ careers</li>
								<li>Has a very specific career direction and would only apply for very specific jobs</li>

			<!-- Problem Statement -->
			<div id="linkedinProblem">
				<div class="section">
					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="basicText">Persona 1 is not using LinkedIn very frequently and therefore is not even looking at the LinkedIn job postings. This user needs to first be engaged in LinkedIn, then be presented with job postings, became curious in a job posting, and then take an action.</p>
						<p class="basicText">Persona 2 is active on the platform but does not regularly take actions regarding job postings because they are not relevant enough to their interests or skills and because they have little motivation to apply. This user needs to be engaged with an interface that motivates them to take actions.</p>
