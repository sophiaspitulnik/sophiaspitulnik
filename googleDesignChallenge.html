					<h3>Research</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="basicText"><strong>Who are the users? What do they need?</strong></p>
						<p class="basicText">I had a few casual conversations with my classmates to better understand their mindsets when joining student organizations as Freshman.</p>
						<p class="basicText"><span>Key Insights:</span></p>
						<ol>
							<li>Some students already knew what clubs they wanted to join before they got to campus while others discovered clubs during or after orientation.</li>
							<li>Some students didn’t even know that they could propose new student organizations when they first got to campus.</li>
						</ol>

						<p class="basicText"><strong>How is this problem already being solved?</strong></p>
						<p class="basicText">Students at my school find student organizations through OrgSync (a platform specifically for student organizations), word of mouth and through Facebook events that organizations post.</p>

							</div>
						</div>
						<p class="basicText"><span>Limitations:</span></p>
						<ol>
							<li>OrgSync is difficult to navigate. Due to its many usability issues, most clubs do not post their club events.</li>
							<li>Facebook has groups and events for many different organizations, it’s not just limited to universities. It's hard to discover organizations that are only for students.</li>

							<li>Make the navigation efficient</li>
							<li>Help students find organizations that they already know they want to join</li>

					<h3>Next Steps</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="basicText">The next steps for this project are to get feedback from other designers and from users. The app should also include a way for student leaders to edit pages and create new events. School staff should also have a slightly different interface so that they can approve groups and events. This app should also be designed as a web app in a browser for students who wish to view it on desktop.</p>
