						<p class="column basicText"><span>Overview:</span> <a href="https://www.braingate.org/" class="link">BrainGate,</a> a research institution at Brown University, is developing technologies that allow patients to control a computer interface with their brains. Their goal is to restore the independence of people affected by various neurologic diseases. While patients use this technology, the BrainGate researchers collect data on the patients’ cursor movements and clicks. In order to improve their technology, the researchers needed an intuitive way to visualize and analyze the data they collect. I worked with a team of Computer Science students at Brown University to design and develop an interactive data visualization tool for the BrainGate researchers. This project was done over the course of a semester as part of a Computer Science class at Brown titled “Creating Modern Web Applications.” Each student group was assigned a client in the Brown or Providence community, in addition to class assignments.</p>
						<p class="column basicText"><span>Scope:</span> During this project we: Interviewed our users (the BrainGate researchers), wrote user stories, wireframed different design solutions, created high fidelity mockups, wrote specifications and requirements, researched frontend and backend technologies that would meet our needs, developed a working prototype, presented to our class and our client, had weekly meetings with the BrainGate engineering team (our client) and some of the researchers to understand their needs and get their feedback on ideas, wireframes, mockups and prototypes.</p>

						<p class="column basicText"><span>Interviews:</span> We began this project by interviewing a few of our users to learn about their jobs, the tools they use and their day to day experiences. This project is very unique in that we have a very small and specific user group that could quickly give us feedback and who can continue to improve their program as they use it.</p>
						<img src="images/BrainGateAssets/researcherIcons.jpg" alt="researchers" class="column">
						<p class="column basicText"><strong>A summary of what we learned:</strong> The researchers are responsible for running sessions where a patient can use the BrainGate technology. While the researchers observe the patients using the system, they collect a lot of numerical data. For example, they collect data on the movement of the cursor over time and how accurate the participant was with the cursor. They take qualitative notes on their sessions with the patients in Word documents. The researchers would like to be able to see this data in a visual format, instead of trying to compare or analyze pure numbers. The researchers are interested in troubleshooting the BrainGate system by comparing the results of different settings, and visualizing the data collected after each session. Specifically, they are interested in visualizing the position and trajectory of the cursor over time, and being able to create filters for the data collected.</p>

							<p class="basicText"><strong>The BrainGate researchers need a way to organize their data, visualize patient cursor movements overtime and annotate data based on their observations.</strong></p>
						</div>
						<p class="column basicText">Before this project, the BrainGate researchers had no real way to visualize the data they collect about the patients’ cursor movement overtime other than just data coordinates, time stamps and what as provided to them in matlab. They also collect notes about their sessions with the patients using this technology in Word documents and record things like “at 0:45 seconds someone made a loud noise in the background and caused a distraction.” The notes were disconnected from the data points. All of their data was stored in MatLab files and not in a database.</p>

I learned about understanding users’ needs, asking good questions, designing a creative experience, communicating my design decisions to clients and engineers and web app technologies.
