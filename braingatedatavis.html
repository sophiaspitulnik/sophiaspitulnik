						<p class="column basicText"><span>Overview:</span> <a href="https://www.braingate.org/" class="link" target="_blank">BrainGate,</a> is a technology that allows patients to control computer interfaces with their brains and is developed at Brown University. I worked with a team of Computer Science students at Brown to design and develop an interactive data visualization tool for the BrainGate researchers. BrainGate seeks to restore the independence of people affected by various neurologic diseases. While patients use BrainGate technology, researchers collect data on the patients’ cursor movements and clicks. In order to improve their technology, the researchers needed an intuitive way to visualize and analyze the data they collect. This project was done as a freelance project as part of a Computer Science class at Brown titled “Creating Modern Web Applications.”</p>

						<!-- <p class="column basicText"><span>Scope:</span> During this project we: Interviewed our users (the BrainGate researchers), wrote user stories, wireframed different design solutions, created high fidelity mockups, wrote specifications and requirements, researched frontend and backend technologies, developed a working prototype, presented to our class and our client, had weekly meetings with the BrainGate engineering team to get feedback on ideas, wireframes, mockups and prototypes.</p> -->

I learned about understanding users’ needs, asking good questions, designing a creative experience, communicating my design decisions to clients and engineers and web app technologies.
