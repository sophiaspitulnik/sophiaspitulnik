I worked on this project in collaboration with two students in the <!-- journalism-design program at the New School in New York.</p>
						<p class="column basicText"><span>Scope:</span> During the course of this project, we collaborated remotely, defined an ethical problem in journalism, ideated several solutions, sketched, wireframed, created high fidelity mockups and wrote an article explaining our product.</p> -->

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="basicText"><strong>Readers of news articles often have little to no information about who wrote the article, this person's point of view and how reliably they can tell the story.</strong></p>
						<div id="problemImages">
							<img src="images/JournalBaseAssets/badExample2.png" alt="bad example">

						</div>
						<p class="basicText" style="margin-top: 0px;">News articles usually provide readers with a byline attributed to the content creator/s. How do we determine whether a journalist’s credentials are legitimate? Credibility is often connected to the publication a journalist works for. While credibility should be applied here, there should be more pressure on how stories are assigned and who can reliably tell what story. Even if news organizations may be covering more diverse topics, the authorship may not necessarily reflect the same levels of diversity and that’s a problem. Marginalized voices aren’t being represented. News media publications do a poor job of providing consumers with a quick and easy way to get in contact with journalists and supply more context.</p>

					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="basicText">During this project I learned about many of the ethical and user experience design problems that journalists, news companies and readers face. We also thought a lot about transparency and expectations for transparency in this information age. Journalbase as proposed above, could potentially cause more problems in terms of discrimination or harassment against journalists. Remaining questions include: how will the information will be collected? Who is considered a journalist and who is not? What can we do for sites that already give clear information about journalists? What information is important to include about each journalist? How could a database of all journalist be used in other ways? What options should there be for sorting or filtering the information in this database? I also practiced collaborating with teammates who were in a different city than me and learned a lot about communication with teammates and understanding each others point of views.</p>
