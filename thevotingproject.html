					<h3>Background</h3>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p class="column basicText"><span>Overview:</span> During the Summer of 2018 I had the opportunity to intern on the Experience Design Team at Digitas (a Digital Marketing Agency in Boston). In addition to working on other experience design projects, I spearheaded an intern case study project for a pro bono client with a team of interns from different disciplines. Our intern case study includes a pitch for a marketing campaign, called The Voting Project, to encourage members of Generation Z to vote on social issues (climate change, gun control and equality) as well as the user experience design for a voter education website.</p>

						<p class="column basicText"><span>Scope:</span> Over the course of this project, I coordinated a team of interns to research Gen Z voting trends and current voting experiences, define a target audience and persona, define a problem, ideate solutions, create a marketing campaign strategy, design the user experience for a product that will improve our target users’ voting experience, refine and apply an already existing brand, create a budget, propose a social media campaign, produce a short animation and pitch to a client.</p>

						<p class="column basicText"><span>Measuring Success:</span> Overall we estimate that our campaign has the potential to increase voting in our target audience by 2-3%. That is 35,465-53,198 more votes. We can measure the success of our campaign by measuring how many people visit our website, how long they stay, the number of interactions, the number of views on our videos, and the number of interactions with our social media content.</p>
						<p class="column basicText"><span>Reflection:</span> This project was a great learning experience and it was awesome to work with such a motivated team. I learned about researching and understanding users, working with an existing brand and applying it to new designs, like the website UI, as well as animation production and how to communicate to a production team. I also learned a lot about other non-design aspects of marketing such as making media decisions based on data that we found in our research, budgeting and social media campaigns.</p>
