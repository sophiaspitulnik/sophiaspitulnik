			<p class="column basicText">During the Summer of 2018 I had the opportunity to intern on the Experience Design Team at Digitas (a Digital Marketing Agency in Boston). In addition to working on other experience design projects, I spearheaded an intern case study project for a pro bono client with a team of interns from different disciplines. Our intern case study includes a pitch for a marketing campaign, called The Voting Project, to encourage members of Generation Z to vote on social issues (climate change, gun control and equality) as well as the user experience design for a voter education website.</p>

They frequently use Instagram, Facebook and Youtube. The idea of mailing in a paper ballot seems very old fashioned to them.</p>

Taylor and Taylor will both be voting on climate change, equality and gun control, but their specific bills, candidates and methods of voting will be different. It is important that we make information and tools that is relevant for people from all over the US accessible from the same place so that the resources can be used and shared amongst college students from different states.</p>

Before asking the user for any information (such as the state that they live in or their zip code), it is important to engage them and show them that the website has something to offer. Because of this, the user is first presented with a reassuring statement about the purpose of the website, then prompted to select which section of the website interests them and then, after they are engaged and see the website has value, asked to provide personal information like state or zip code.</p>

It was awesome to work with this team and see everyone's work come together in the final product.

			<p class="column basicText">Overall we estimate that our campaign has the potential to increase voting in our target audience by 2-3%. That is 35,465-53,198 more votes. We can measure the success of our campaign by measuring how many people visit our website, how long they stay, the number of interactions, the number of views on our videos, and the number of interactions with our social media content.</p>

			<h4 class="column">Reflection</h4>
			<hr>
			<p class="column basicText">This project was a great learning experience and it was awesome to work with such a motivated team. I learned about researching and understanding users, working with an existing brand and applying it to new designs, like the website UI, as well as animation production and how to communicate to a production team. I also learned a lot about other non-design aspects of marketing such as making media decisions based on data that we found in our research, budgeting and social media campaigns.</p>
